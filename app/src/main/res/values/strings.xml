        Settings apply on-the-fly, no need to set wallpaper again after changing
        settings.\n\nSettings

        that affect performance significally are “Density” and “Frame rate”.
        High density increases draw time while high frame rate means more smoothness but more CPU
        load and less battery life while wallpaper is visible.\n\nIf

        you experience lags, try to reduce “Density”, and make sure the “Frame rate” is
        high enough for selected “Speed factor”.\n\n“Speed factor”

        does not affect performance, however, if you lower the “Speed factor”, you can
        also lower the “Frame rate” without noticeable smoothness degrade.\n\nAlso,

        setting a background image may lower the draw performance.
